# Usage

The most basic usage of VerGenTool is run compiled project or clone project from GitHub
and build it. Once you've downloaded release or cloned the project, that process looks
something like this:

1. Download release or cloned the project and build it.
2. Run project locally to see how it looks.
3. Enter data and get your results.

Cool, right? _It is_. That said, the designed methods that VerGenTool offers can help you
simplified your tasks and serve as the foundation for whatever you're interested in building.
