# Contributing to VerGenTool

Looking to contribute something to VerGenTool? **Here's how you can help.**

## Quick start

We only accept issues that are have existing labels (e.g. bug reports or feature requests).
Bugs must be isolated and reproducible problems that we can fix within the VerGenTool core.

## Key branches

- `master` is the latest, deployed version.

## Rules and general provisions for pull requests

- We don't accept pull requests before testing the correctness of all product functionality
- Pull requests that do not solve an existing issue are essentially un-prioritized–don't expect these to be addressed quickly
- The files in this repository are generated elsewhere and we rarely merge PR's directly into master
- Try not to pollute your pull request with unintended changes–keep them simple and small
- Try to share which OS your code has been tested in before submitting a pull request
